## _A simple shopping list app_

I made this app to learn the basics of React Native (and also because I hated making shopping list on my Notepad application).

## Features

- Well it's just an app to make your shopping list...

## How to use it ?

- The main screen is where your shopping list will display
- Clicking on a checkbox will show the item as "purchased" by coloring it in grey.
- If you click on the basket, your shopping list will be cleared

- If you click on the paper icon, you will be taken to the second screen where all the available items are displayed :

- You can add an item by typing into the text input at the bottom of the screen. When you submit, the item will automatically be added in the availables items AND it will be added to your current shopping list by default.
- You can see if an item is in your shopping list by checking the emoji before the item name. ✅ means that the item is in the list and ❌ means that it isn't.
- You can click the state emoji to add/remove item from your shopping list.
- If you want to delete an item from the list of available items, simply press the red button at the end of the item line.

## What you should know about the app

- I only tested this app on Android, it might not build for IOS (I'm pretty sure it won't build tbh).
- That's pretty much it, enjoy my first React Native app :-D
